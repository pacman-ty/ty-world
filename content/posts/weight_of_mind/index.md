&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My mind feels quiet.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A forced calm. As if in attempt to say enough. Enough to the relentless guilt and dwelling that chews my soul.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I feel exhausted, like I’m carry a constant weight.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Refusing to cast them away, I can’t help but feel like a Nietzschean cesspool of guilt and cruelty.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A slow and miserable drain.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nine circles under.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At least it’s quiet.
