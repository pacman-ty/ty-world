&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does not man, perhaps, love something besides well-being? Perhaps he is just as fond of suffering? Perhaps suffering is just as great a benefit to him as well-being? Man is sometimes extraordinarily, passionately, in love with suffering, and that is a fact."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€” Fyodor Dostoevsky, _Notes from Underground_
