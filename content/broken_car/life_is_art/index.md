&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The value of a work of art is not determined by whether it has a happy ending or not. There is hope that one values life itself as a work of art. To see life as something that does not need a happy ending to justify its continued existence, for its beauty eternally justifies itself.
