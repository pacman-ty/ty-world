&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Gregor crawled a little further forward and held his head close to the floor, trying to catch her glance. Was he a beast, when he was so moved by music? It was as if he were being shown the way to the unknown nourishment he craved."

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; â€” Franz Kafka, _The Metamorphosis_
