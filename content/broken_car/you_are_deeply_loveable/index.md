&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You are deeply loveable"

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A statement so simple, presumably so obvious to most of us, we never took the time to say it to ourselves. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When we tell ourselves that we are deeply loveable whose love or affirmation do we speak of? Is it our own? Or perhaps, are we waiting for someone else to say these words to us; a patient attempt to satisfy our deepest insecurities?

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Somewhere amongst the confusion we forget ourselves and move forward.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that's ok.
